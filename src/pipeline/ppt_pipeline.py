"""Unified PPT fetch → dHash dedup → OCR → classify pipeline.

Two consumption patterns share the same four stages:

  PPTPipeline.submit(...)        → returns a ``PPTAsyncHandle`` that holds
                                   in-flight OCR ``Future`` s.  Caller (the
                                   LectureRunner) does ASR transcription in
                                   parallel, then calls ``handle.drain()`` to
                                   block for stats.
  PPTPipeline.run_blocking(...)  → ``submit`` + immediate ``drain``.  Used by
                                   the resummarize path where there is no
                                   accompanying ASR to overlap with.

The four stages are identical in both paths:

  1. Fetch the PPT list from iCourse and ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` each row into
     ``ppt_pages`` with ``ocr_status='pending'``.  Idempotent — safe to call
     across resumed runs.  Items typically come from the prefetch cache the
     previous lecture warmed up; if absent, ``submit`` re-schedules.
  2. Collect image bytes for every still-pending page.  Pulls from
     ``Scheduler.image_cache`` (prefetch) first, then falls back to a sync
     ``fetch_ppt_image`` call for any pending row missing from the cache
     (typically a stale row from a prior interrupted run, or a download
     that failed in the prefetch pool).
  3. Sliding-window dHash dedup over the chronologically ordered pending
     pages — losers are stamped ``dedup_dropped`` and removed before OCR.
  4. For each survivor: submit an OCR job to ``Scheduler.submit_ocr`` (which
     gates on the dynamic semaphore, so live concurrency tracks
     ResourceMonitor's target).  Workers classify the OCR'd text as
     ``invalid`` (matches one of the classroom-noise screens) or ``done``,
     and write the row in place.

``get_done_ppt_pages`` only surfaces rows with status='done', so dropped /
invalid / failed pages naturally drop out of the LLM prompt.
